what is bootstrap CDN ?
Bootstrap CDN (Content Delivery Network) is a service that hosts the Bootstrap framework files on a network of servers distributed around the world. By using a CDN, developers can link to the Bootstrap CSS and JavaScript files directly from their web pages without having to download and host the files on their own servers.

This can lead to faster load times, improved performance, and reduced bandwidth usage, as users can download the files from a server that is geographically closer to them. Popular Bootstrap CDNs include those provided by MaxCDN, jsDelivr, and CDNJS.
