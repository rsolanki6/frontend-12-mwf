<span>This text is in a span element.</span>
<p>A span is an inline container used to mark up a part of a text, or a part of a document. It does not inherently represent anything. When no other semantic element is appropriate, the span element can be used to group elements for styling purposes (using the class or id attributes), or because they share attribute values, such as lang. It should be used only when no other element is suitable. The span element is often used with the global attributes, such as class, lang, or dir.</p>
