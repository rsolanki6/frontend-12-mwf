What is the purpose of the label element in a form, and how does it improve accessibility?
    The label element in an HTML from serves to associate descriptive text with a form control(like an input field or checkbox),
    which improves both usability and accessibility by providing content for users and enabling screen readres to communicate
    the purpose of the field.

    purpose of the <label> element :-
        
        User-friendly descriptions :-
            provides a clear, visual description of the information that should be entered into a form field, helping sighted 
            users understand the form's purpose

        Semantic meaning :-
            Gives semantic meaning to form control, connecting a specific text description to the corresponding input or control.

    How it improves accessibility :-

        Screen reader integration :-
            when the for attribute of the label element is correctly linked to the id attribute of a form control, assitive techonologies like screen
            reader will read the label's text when the user focuses on the field. this tells screen reader users exactly what information is expected.

        Expanded clickable area :-
            users can click on the label text to activate or focus on the associated input field. this is particularly beneficial for users with motor impairments,
            as they have large area to click, increasing the ease of interaction

        Reduces Ambiguity :-
            by clearly labeling each form field, the label element removes ambiguity, ensuring that all users, especially those relying on assitive techonologies,
            can understand their input requirements correctly.
