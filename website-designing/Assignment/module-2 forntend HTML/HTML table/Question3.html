Why should tables be used sparingly for layout purposes? What is a better alternative?
    Tables should be used sparingly for layout purposes because it leads to accessibility issues for visually impaired users, creates inflexible designs,
    to use Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), specifically modern techniques like Flexbox and CSS Grid, in combination with semantix HTML element (like <div>, <header>, <section>, etc).


    Why Avoid Tables for layout
    *) Semantic Incorrectness: HTML is a markup language meant to describe content, not presentation. The <table> tag is specifically intended for displaying genuinely tabular data (like a spreadsheet or database results). Using it for layout is semantically incorrect and confuses the intended meaning of the content.
    *) Accessiblity Problems: Screen reader for visually impaired users interput the linear HTML code and expact tables to contain structured data. When tables are used for layout, the screen reader's output becomes confusing, making the site inaccessible to a large segment of users.
    *) Lack of Responsiveness: Tables are rigid and do not adapt well to different screen sizes and devices (e.g., mobile phones, tablets). This makes it diffcult to create mobile-friendly, fluid designs, a crucial aspect of modern web developement.
    *) Messy and Complex Code: Achieving complex layouts with tables often requires deeply nested tables and extra markup, resulting in "tag soup" that is hard to write, maintain, and debug.
    *) Slower page load time: Browser often have to download most, if not all, of a table's content before they can render it, which can slow down page load times. CSS layouts, which seprate presentation from content, generally load faster.
    *) Difficult in Redesign: with table-based layouts, layout information is intermingled with content in HTML. changing the design often requires extensive changes to every page's HTML, whereas a CSS-based layout can be completely restyled by simply modifying a songle, external CSS file.
    *) Poor SEO: Search engines prefer clean, semantic HTML. content buried within complex table structures may be harder for search engine crawlers to index effectively, potentially hurting a website's ranking.

    The Better Alternative
    The recommended alternative is to use CSS for all layout and presentation needs.

    *) Semantic HTML: Use appropriate HTML elements (like <div>, <header>, <footer>, <nav>, <section>, <artical>) to structure your content logically.
    *) Modern CSS Techniques: utilize powerful CSS layout tools like Flexbox and CSS Grid, which are specifically design for creating flexible, responsive, and complex layout with clean markup.
