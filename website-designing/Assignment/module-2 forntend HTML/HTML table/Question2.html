What is the difference between colspan and rowspan in tables? Provide examples.
    colspan and rowspan are HTML attributes used within <td> (table data) or <th> (table header) tags to control
    how many columns or rows a single cell should occupy in a table.

    1) colspan (Column Span):
       *) Purpose: Merges cells horizontally. it specifices how many columns a single cell should extend across.
       *) Effect: The cell will visually span the width of multiple columns, effictively combining them into one wider cell
       
       Exaple:
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th colspan="2">Name</th>
                <th>Age</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>John</td>
                <td>Doe</td>
                <td>30</td>
            </tr>
        </table>



    2) rowspan (Row span):
        *) Purpose: Merges cells vertiaclly. it sepcifices how many rows a single cell should extend down.
        *) Effects: The cell will visually span the height of multiple rows, effectively combining them into one taller cell.

        Example:
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th rowspan="2">Category</th>
                    <th>Item 1</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <th>Item 2</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Fruits</td>
                    <td>Apple</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
