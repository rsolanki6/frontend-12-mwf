Explain the structure of an HTML table and the purpose of each of the following elements: <table>, <tr>, <th>, <td>, and <thead>. 
    An HTML table provides a astructure way to present data in rows and column.its fundamental structure involves several key elements:

    *) <table>: This is the root element that defines the entire HTML table. All other table-releated elements are nested within this tag.

    *) <thead>: This element groups the header content of an HTML table. it typically contains one or more <tr> elements that define the table's
                column headers. Using <thead> allows browsers to handle large tables more effectively, for instance, by enabling independent scrolling of the table
                body while kepping the header visible, pr by repeating the header on each page when printing.

    *) <tr>: This element defines a table row, it acts as a container for the individual cells within that row, which can either header cells (<th>) or data cells (<td>).
    
    *) <td>: This element defines a table data cell. it is used for cells that contain the actual data within the table. Each <td> element represents a single data point in a table row.


    Example :
    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Header1</th>
                <th>Header2</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Data A1</td>
                <td>Data B1</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Data A2</td>
                <td>Data B2</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
