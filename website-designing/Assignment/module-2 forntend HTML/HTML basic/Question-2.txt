Explain the basic strcture of an HTML document. identify the mandatory tags and their purpose.
    An HTML document follows a hierarchical structure, beginning with a declaration and then containing nested elements that define the content and its presentation.

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
        <title>Document Title</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <!-- Visible content goes here -->
    </body>
    </html>


    Mandatory Tags and THeir Purposes :-
        <!DOCTYPE html> :-
        This is a document type declaration, not an HTML tag. it informs the web browser about the HTML version being used,
        ensuring the browser renders the page in "standards mode" (HTML5 in this case) rather than "quirks mode".

        <html> :-
        This is the root element of an HTML page. All other element including the <head> and <body>, are nested within it. 
        The lang attribute (e.g. lang="en") specifies the primary language of the document, which is important for accessibility
        and search engine optimization.

        <head> :-
        This element contains metadata about the HTML document that is not directly Visibleon the web page itself. This includes :-

            *<meta charset="UTF-8"> :- 
            specifies the character encoding for the document, ensuring proper display of various characters.UTF-8 is the recommended encoding.

            *<meta name="viewpoint" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"> :-
            Configures the viewpoint for responsive design, controlling how the page scales on different devices.

            *<title> :-
            Defines the title of the HTML document, which appears in the browser's title bar or tab. This is also used by search engines and when
            bookmarking a page.

        <body> :-
        This element contains all the Visible content of the web page, including text, images, links, forms, and other interactive elements.
        This is where the main content that users see and interact with resides.
