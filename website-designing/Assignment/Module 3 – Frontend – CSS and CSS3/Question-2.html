Explain the concept of CSS specificity. How do conflicts between multiple styles get resolved?
    
    CSS specificity is the algorithm used by browsers to determine which CSS declarations apply
    to an element when multiple rules target the same element and defined conflicting styles for the same
    property. the declaration with the highest specificity "wins" and its styles is applied.
    
    
    Specificity Hierarchy and Calculation :

    specificity is calculated based on a point system, generally represented as a three-column value (a,b,c):

        inline styles (a) :
            style applied directly to an HTML element using the style attribute have the highest specificity.
            they are assigned a value in the 'a' column

        
        IDs (b) :
            selectors targrting an ekement by its id attributr are highly specific.  Each ID selector adds a value
            to the 'b' column


        Classes, Attributes, and Pseudo-classes (c) :
            selector like class selectors (.my-class), attribute selector ([type="text"]), and pseudo-classes (:hover, :first-child)
            contributr to the 'c' column.



    Conflict Resolution :

    when multiple CSS rules declare conflicting styles for thr same propert on an element, the browser resolves the conflict by :

        Specificity :
            the rule with the highest specificity score takes precedence, for example, a style defined with an ID selector will override
            a style defined with a class selector if both target the same property.


        Order of Appearance (if specificity is equal) :
            if two or more rules have the exact same specificity, the rule that appears later in the stylesheet (or is imported later) will
            take precedence.

        !Important (Override) :
            the !important declaration, when added to a property value, overrides all other specificity rules, including inline styles. However,
            its use is generally discouraged as it can lead to difficult-to-manage CSS.

        Inheritance :
            some CSS properties are inheritend by child element from their parent element, if a propert is not explicitly set on a child element,
            it may inherit the value form its parent. however, a directly applied style on the child element will override inherited styles.
