Explain the CSS box model and its components (content, padding, border, margin). How does each affect the size of an element?
    The CSS Box model is a fundamental concept in web developement that describes how HTML elements are rectangular boxes on a webpage.
    Each Box consists of four distinct layers: content, padding, border, margin.

    Components of CSS Box model:

        *) Content: 
                1) This is the innermost area where the actual content of the element resides, such as text , images, or other HTML elements.
                2) The width and height CSS properties directly control the dimensions of the content area.

        *) Padding:
                1) Padding is the tranparent space that surrounds the content area and lies inside the element's border.
                2) it creates a buffer betweeen the content and the border, preventing the content from touching the edges of the element.
                3) Padding values (e.g., padding-top, padding-reight, padding-bottom, padding-left) are added to the content area's dimensions, increasing the overall size of the element within its border.


        *) Border:
                1) The border is a line that encloses the padding and content area.
                2) it provides a visual boundary for the element and can have varoius styles, widths, and colors.
                3) The border's thickness (e.g., border-width) adds to the element's total size, extending outward from the padding.


        *) Margin:
                1) Margin is the transparent space outside the element's border, separating it from other elements on the page.
                2) it controls the spacing between different elements and between the elements and the edges of its containing parent.
                3) Margin values (e.g., margin-top, margin-right, margin-bottom, margin-left) do not add to the element's visual size, but rather create space around it, influencing its position relative to other elements.


    How Each Component Affects Element SIze:

        *) Content: Directly determines the base width and height of the element.

        *) Padding: Increases the element's overall visual size (including the area within the border) by adding space between the content and te border.

        *) Border: Further increases the element's overall visual size by adding a visible line around the padding and content.

        *) Margin: Does not contribute to the element's internal dimensions but affects its external spacing and positioning on the page.


    Box-Sizing Property:

        By default, the box-sizing: content-box model is used, meaning that wisth and height refer only to the conent are.
        paddingand border are added on top of these dimensions.

        Alternatively, box-sizing: border-box can be used. in this model, width and height include the padding and border,
        making it easier to control the overall dimensions of an element.
