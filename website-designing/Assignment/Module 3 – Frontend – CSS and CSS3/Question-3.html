 What is the different detween internal, external, and inline CSS? Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each approach.
    
    CSS (Cascading Style Sheet) is essential for defining the presentation of web pages, including layout, colors, and fonts, There are three primary methods to apply CSS:
    
    1) inline CSS: Applied directly within an HTML element's style attribute, affecting only the specific element.
    2) internal CSS: Define within a <style> tag in the <head> section of an HTML document, influencing the entire page. 
    3) externla CSS: Contained in seperate .css file linked to the HTML document, allowing for consistent styling across multiple pages.



    Advantages & Disadvantages of inline, internal and external CSS:

    Advantages:
        1) inline CSS:
            *) Using style attributes we can provide styles directly to our HTML elements.
            *) Inline CSS overrides external and internal style with higher specificity.
            *) No need to create and upload a seperate document as in the external style.
            *) Inline style has higher specificity, allowing precise control over individual elements.
            *) Enables dynamic style changes using Javascript or server-side logic.
            *) Inline styles don't require seperate CSS files, potentially reducing HTTP requests.

    Disadvantages:
        1) inline CSS:
            *) Adding style attribute to every HTML element is time-consuming.
            *) Styling multiple elements can increase your page's size and download time, impacting overall page performance.
            *) Reduced sepration of concerns between HTML structure and CSS.
            *) Inline styles cannot be used to style pseudo-element and pseudo-classes.
            *) It can be difficult to maintain consistency and make global style updates.

        ---------------------------

    Advantages:
        2) Internal CSS:
            *) Localixed Styling : keep styles within the HTML file, avoding conflicts with other pages and making it easier to manage styles at the local level.
            *) Higher specificity : Internal CSS has higher specificity than external CSS, allowing easier overriding of external styles within tha same HTML file.
            *) Performance : Reduces HTTP requests, potentially enhancing performance as no additional CSS file need to be loaded.
            *) Ease of implementation  : simple to use and implement making it easy to quickly apply styles to a single page.

    Disadvantages:
        2) Internal CSS:
            *) Repetition : styles must be repeated in multiple HTML files if the same styles are needed across different pages.
            *) Increased file size : embedding CSS in HTML increases the file size of the HTML document.
            *) Reduced reusability : limited code reusablity across different webpages.
            *) Limited management : managing styles across multiple pages can become difficult a centralized stylesheet

        ---------------------------

    Advantages:
        3) external CSS:
            *) Centralizes styling : all styles are in one place, allowing for global changes across multiple pages by editing a single file. This simplifies maintenance and ensures consistency.
            *) Faster page loading : the external CSS file is downloaded once then cached by the browser. sunsequent page loads that use the same stylesheet will be faster as the browser retrieves the style from its cache.
            *) Improved code organization and readability : separating content form presentation leads to cleaner, more organized, and easier-to-read code.
            *) Reusability : styles defined in as external stylesheet can be reused across numerous HTML pages, promoting efficiency.
            *) Reduced bandwidth usage : caching of the CSS file reduces the amount of the data transferred on sunsequent page visits.

    Disadvantages:
        3) external CSS:
            *) Initial page load delay : the browser needs to download the external CSS file before rendering the page correctly. this can lead to a brief "flash of unstyled content" (FOUC) if the CSS file is large or the network connection is slow.
            *) Increased HTTP requests : each linked external stylesheet requires an additional HTTP requests, which can slightly increase the overall page load time, especially if many separates CSS files are used.
            *) Specificity challenges : understanding the cascade and specificity rules can be more complex when dealing with multiple external stylesheet or combined with other CSS types(inline/internal).
            *) potential for ove-styling : if not managed carefully, a single external stylesheet can lead to unintended styling changes accross different parts of a large website
