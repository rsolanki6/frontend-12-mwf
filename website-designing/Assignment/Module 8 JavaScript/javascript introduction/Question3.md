# Use of the `<script>` Tag in HTML

The `<script>` tag in HTML is used to include and execute JavaScript code within a web page. It allows developers to add dynamic behavior, interactivity, and logic to otherwise static HTML content.

---

## Purpose of the `<script>` Tag

The `<script>` tag is mainly used to:
- Write **inline JavaScript code** directly inside an HTML file
- **Link external JavaScript files** to an HTML document
- Control the behavior of HTML elements
- Handle user interactions and events

## Using JavaScript Inside HTML

JavaScript code can be written directly between the opening and closing `<script>` tags.

Example:
```html
<script>
  alert("Hello, World!");
</script>
```
