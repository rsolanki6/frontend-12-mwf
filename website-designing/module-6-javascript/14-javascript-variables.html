what is javascript variable?
     js variable is just like container where we stored an information about data i.e called variable
     OR
     javascript stored defined variables via var | let | const keyword

     var a=10;
     let a=10;
     const a=10;


     var: var is defind a variables
          var is used to re-assigned and redeclared data
          var a=10;
          var b=10;
          console.log(a)
          console.log(b)


     let: let is also defind a variables
          let is used to re-assigned but cannot redeclared data

          let a=10;

     
     const: const is also defind a variables
          const is used to neither re-assigned or neither redeclared data can not be changed 
          const a=10;
