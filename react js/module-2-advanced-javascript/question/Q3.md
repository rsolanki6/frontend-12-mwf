# What are the data types in JavaScript?

JavaScript has **8 data types**, divided into **primitive** and **non-primitive (reference)** types.

## Primitive Data Types
Primitive types store **single, immutable values**.

1. **Number**
     - Represents integers and floating-point number
     - Example:
     ```javascript
     let x = 42;
     let y = 3.14;
     ```

2. **String**
     - Represent text
     - Example:
     ```javascript
     let name = "Javascript";
     ```

3. **Boolean**
     - Represents `true` and `false`
     - Example:
     ```javascript
     let isActive = true;
     ```

4. **Undefined**
     - A variable that has been declared but not assigned a value
     - Example:
     ```javascript
     let a;
     ```

5. **Null**
     - Represent an intentional absence of any value
     - Example:
     ```javascript
     let b = null;
     ```

6. **Symbol**
     - Represent a unique and immutable identifier
     - Example:
     ```javascript
     let id = Symbol("id");
     ```

7. **BigInt**
     - Used for very large integer
     - Example:
     ```javascript
     let big = 123900987654321234567n;
     ```

## Non-Primitive (Referance) Data Types

8. **Object**
     - Used to store collections of data and more complex entities
     - Includes objects, arrays, functions and dates
     - Example:
     ```javascript
     let user = {
          name: "Alex",
          age: 25
     };
     ```


## Quick Summary
| Type | Category |
|----|----|
| Number | Primitive |
| String | Primitive |
| Boolean | Primitive |
| Undefined | Primitive |
| Null | Primitive |
| Symbol | Primitive |
| BigInt | Primitive |
| Object | Non-Primitive |

JavaScript is **dynamically typed**, meaning variables can hold values of any data type without explicit declarations.
