# Is JavaScript interpreted or compiled?

Javascript is **Both interpreted and compiled** - depending on how and where it runs.

## Traditional view
Originally, Javascript was considered an **interpreted language** because:
- Code was executed line by line
- No seperate compiler step was visible to developers
- It run directly in the browser

## Modern Reality
Modern Javascript engines(like **VB**, **SpiderMonkey**, and **JavaScriptCOre**) use **Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation**:
- Javascript code is first **parsed**
- Then **compiled into bytecode or machine code**
- Frequently used code is optimized and recompiled for speed

This means Javascript is **compiled at runtime**, not ahead of time.

## How It Works (Simplified)
1. Parse Javascript code
2. Convert it to  bytecode
3. JIT compiler turns hot code into machine code
4. Execute the optimized code

## So what should you say?
- In pratice : **Javascript is interpreted language**
- Techinically : **Javascript is JIT-compiled at runtime**
