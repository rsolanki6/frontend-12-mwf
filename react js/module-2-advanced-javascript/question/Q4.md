# Difference between var, let, and const?

In JavaScript, `var`, `let`, and `const` are used to declare variables, but they behave differently in terms of **scope**, **hoisting**, and **reassignment**.

## 1. `var`
- Function-scoped
- Can be redeclared and reassigned
- Hoisted and initialized as `undefined`
- Avoid using in modern Javascript

```javascript
var x = 10;
var x = 20; //allowed
```

## 2. `let`
- Blocked-scoped
- Cannot be redeclared in the same scope 
- Can be reassigned
- Hoisted but not initialized (Temporal Dead Zone)

```javascript
let y = 10;
y = 20; //allowed
```

## 3. `const`
- Block-scoped
- Cannot be redeclared or reassigned
- Must be initialized at declaration
- Hoisted but not initialized (Temporal Dead Zone)

```javascript
const z = 10;
// z = 20; Error
```

**Note**: Objects and arrays declared with `const` can still be modified.

```javascript
const arr = [1, 2];
arr.push(3); //allowed
```
