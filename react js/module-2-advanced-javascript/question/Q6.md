# What is null?

`null` is a **primitive data type** in JavaScript that represents the **intentional absence of any object value**.

## What does `null` Mean?
- It is used to explicitly indicate that a variable should have no **no value**
- It is assigned **manually by the developer**
- Often used to reset or clear a variable

## Example

### 1. Explicit Assignment
```javascript
let value = null;
```

### 2. Clearing an Object Referance
```javascript
let user = {name: "Alex"};
user = null; // object referance removed
```

### 3. API or Database Responses
`null` is commonly returned when data is empty or unavailable.

`null` VS `undefined`
| null | undefined |
|------|-----------|
| Assigned intentionally | Assigned automatically |
| Means "no value" | Means "not assigned yet" |
| Developer-controlled | JavaScript-controlled |

## Important Notes
- `typeof null` returns `"object"` (this is a known JavaScript bug)
- `null` has no properties or methods
- it represents an empty or non-existent object reference
