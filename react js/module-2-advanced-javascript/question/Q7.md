# Difference between == and ===?

In javascript, `==` and `===` are comparison operators, but they behave very differently.

## `==` (loose Equality)
- compares **Values only**
- Performs **type coercion** (automatically converts types)
- can lead to unexpected results

```javascript
5 == "5"; // true
true == 1; // true
null == undefeined; // true
```

## `===` (Strict Equality)
- Compares both value and type
- No type coercion
- More predictable and safar

```javascript
5 === "5"; // false
true === 1; //false
null === undefined; // false
```

## Key Differences

| Features | == | === |
|----------|----|-----|
| Type Coercion | Yes | No |
| Checks Type | No | Yes |
| Predictability | Low | High |
| Recommended | Avoid | Use |

## Best Pratice
Always use `===` (strict equality) unless you have a very specific reason to use `==`.
